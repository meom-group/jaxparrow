    Compute the stencil weights of every field point using Fornberg's algorithm [6]_.
    At every point, four combinations of stencil weights are computed in both directions and padding.
    At the domain boundaries, or in the presence of land, the stencil width is decreased adequately,

    Parameters
    ----------
    field : Float[Array, "lat lon"]
        2d field used to infer land positions
    lat : Float[Array, "lat lon"], optional
        2d grid of latitude points, used to compute spatial steps if ``dx`` or ``dy`` is not provided.

        Defaults to `None`
    lon : Float[Array, "lat lon"], optional
        2d grid of longitude points, used to compute spatial steps if ``dx`` or ``dy`` is not provided.

        Defaults to `None`
    dx : Float[Array, "lat lon"], optional
        2d grid of spatial steps along the x-direction.

        Defaults to `None`
    dy : Float[Array, "lat lon"], optional
        2d grid of spatial steps along the y-direction.

        Defaults to `None`
    stencil_width : int, optional
        Width of the stencil.
        As we use C-grids, it should be an even integer.

        Defaults to ``stencil_width``

    Parameters
    ----------
    field : Float[Array, "lat lon"]
        2d field to differentiate
    stencil_weights : Float[Array, "2 2 lat lon stencil_width"]
        Tensor of stencil weights of every ``field`` point in both directions and for both padding
    axis : Literal[0, 1]
        Axis along which interpolation is performed
    pad_left : bool
        Padding direction.
        For example, following NEMO convention [1]_,
        interpolating from U to T points requires a `left` padding
        (the midpoint between $U_i$ and $U_{i+1}$ corresponds to $T_{i+1}$),
