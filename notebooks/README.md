We designed two notebooks, one with the extremely idealised scenario of a [gaussian eddy](gaussian_eddy), and a realistic one focusing on the [Alboran sea](alboran_sea) area.

The goal is both to showcase step-by-step how **jaxparrow** can be used, and to demonstrate the interest of the variational approach we propose.
