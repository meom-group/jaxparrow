We designed three notebooks, one with the idealised scenario of a [gaussian eddy](gaussian_eddy.md), 
a realistic one (eNATL60 run) focusing on the [Alboran sea](nemo_alboran.md) area, and its counterpart one using [Duacs data](duacs_alboran.md).

The goal is both to showcase step-by-step how **jaxparrow** can be used, and to demonstrate the interest of the variational approach we propose.
